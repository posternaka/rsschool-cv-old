### about me
>A year ago, I set myself the goal of becoming a developer. During this time, I regularly study, look for answers to questions, watch tutorials, attend various intensives, read books.
I'm interested in what I do. I try to give my best. Sometimes it is difficult, but when you overcome it, you become one step closer to your goal.
